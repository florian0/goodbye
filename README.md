# Goodbye

Goodbye Github. It was a nice time but it will now come to an end.

This does **NOT** mean it is no longer allowed to use, share or publish my content. If you have backups, feel free to do so. Also, all forks of my software are still available.

I strongly disagree with Microsoft's politics and therefore decided to remove all of my content from the now "Microsoft-owned" Github. I do not want Microsoft to (passively) gain attention and/or money with my content. 

Hello, gitlab!
